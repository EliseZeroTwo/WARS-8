# WARS-8

Virtual Console written in Rust that implements the PICO-8 API (or is trying to). Game support is limited at the moment.

It can run both Lua scripts and WASM binaries, the Lua version is my fork of Lua 5.4 with PicoLua support

## Current Supported Formats
* .wasm (WASM binary)
* .lua (Lua Script)
* .p8 (PICO-8 cartridge)

## Rust API, Template and Examples

## Docs

Docs can be found [here](https://github.com/EliseZeroTwo/WARS-8/blob/main/docs/src/SUMMARY.md) but may not reflect latest changes as this is in heavy development.
