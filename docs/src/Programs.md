# Programs

Every program should contain at least three functions, `_init`, `_update`, and `_draw`.

___init__ is called once on load of the program.

___update__ is called every frame and should handle all logic/state updates for the program.

___draw__ is also called every frame and should handle all drawing to the framebuffer.
